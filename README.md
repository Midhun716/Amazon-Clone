# Amazon-Clone
# Amazon Clone Website

This project is a simple clone of the Amazon website, created by me. The clone is designed using HTML and CSS, aiming to replicate the visual layout and user interface of the original Amazon site.

## Details

- **HTML & CSS**: The clone is built entirely using HTML for the structure and CSS for styling. It does not include any interactive features or backend functionality.
- **No User Authentication**: The clone does not support user sign-in or sign-up functionality. It is a static representation of the Amazon website's frontend.

## Purpose

The main goal of this project is to showcase how HTML and CSS can be used to create a visually appealing and functional static webpage that mimics a popular e-commerce site.
